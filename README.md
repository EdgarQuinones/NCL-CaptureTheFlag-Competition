# NCL-CTF-Competition
I lead a team of 7 to compete in the National Cyber League CTF Competition. This took place during an entire weekend, from April 19th to April 21st. Below are all the skills I learned. Most links contain my notes of things I learned and used to study for the competition.
## Custom Learning Material 
We created our notes based on the practice problems to better train our team.

## Open Source Intelligence
Obtain information using publicly available data and tools.

## Cryptography
Information is key, but it's not going to be easy to get it. Decipher these hidden messages to learn what is really going on.

## Password Cracking
Try your hand at cracking these passwords.

## Forensics
Do you know where to look for the evidence? Help find the forensic trail that malicious actors leave behind.

## Log Analysis
Logs hold a ton of information. The hard part is using them to learn what happened. Analyze these logs to determine what the hackers have been up to.

## Network Traffic Analysis
Determine what happened and exactly when it happened by looking at network traffic captures.

## Wireless Access Exploitation
Wireless security has advanced quickly in the past several years, but many routers are still configured with bad security measures. See if you can break into these poorly protected networks and secure your own.

## Scanning & Reconnaissance
Before you catch the hackers, you need to find them. Put your tracking skills to the test and find out what the hackers are up to.

## Enumeration & Exploitation
Hacking isn't just for the bad guys. The good guys need to know it too. Try to break some training programs and some of the hackers' software. You might even be able to secure your own programs.

## Web Application Exploitation
Find and demonstrate vulnerabilities in various city systems.
